Title: Assignment 2
Template: 720

##Introduction

Goal: set up the Particle. Connect it to the Internet. Learn how to
craete connected functions, all of the nifty Particle things. Most
basic: make an entirely on-device action/reaction. Next: action on
device -> action on net. Then: action on net -> action on device.

In [Assignment 1](assignment1.html), you learned how to get data from
the Internet and visualize it. In this assignment, you'll use your
newfound Javascript skills to interact with a physical device; you'll
also learn a bit of microcontroller programming in C.



##Goals

Graph some data from Bean's built-in sensors

###B-level work
Add a sensor to Bean (e.g. light) and graph that

###A-level work
Make the Bean do something with the phone such as take a photo.
