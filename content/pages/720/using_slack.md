Title: Using Slack
Template: 720

Slack is a system that is like a combination of instant messaging,
email, and forums. We'll use Slack in the class for annoucements,
discussions, and getting help.

The URL for Slack for our class is
[http://hcin720-fall15.slack.com](http://hcin720-fall15.slack.com).

To get connected to Slack, I will have to send you an invitation,
which I'll do after the first class.

##Channels
Slack is organized into "channels," which are topic-specifc areas.
I've set up a number of channels to start with, and may add some more
as the semester proceeds. Slack organizes channels alphabetically. At
the start of class, we have:

- **#announcements**: I'll post announcements, including new
	assignments, readings, class location changes, and so on here.
- **#general**: For general questions and discussions that don't fit
	into any of the other channels.
- **#ia1**: I'll create a channel for each assignment. This channel is
	for Individual Assignment 1. You can use this to ask questions
	specifically about IA1, post tips and inspirations, or anything else
	related to the assignment.
- **#inspirations**: Post general inspirations and examples of
	Internet-enabled devices here.
- **#random**: For stuff unrelated or only somewhat related to class.
	Jokes, funny videos, etc. Be nice.
- **#setup**: If you have issues or tips around getting set up for the
	assignments, post here.

##Mentions
If you want to ensure that someone (such as me) sees your message, use
a mention. You do this like Twitter: use the `@` symbol with the
person's username. For example: `@dan I'm missing a wire from my kit.`
When you type the `@` symbol Slack will show you a list of people so
you don't have to remember usernames.

##Direct messages
You can do a direct chat with someone via the Direct Messages menu on
the left. This can be seen only by the two people involved in the
chat. So if you direct message another student, I will not be able to
see it. You can use direct messages to communicate with me regarding
confidential class matters such as grades. If you have questions which
might benefit other students with the answers, please post them to one
of the public channels (and optionally use `@dan` to get my
attention).

##Notifications
You can (and should) download one of the many fine [Slack
apps](https://slack.com/apps), or at the very least enable desktop
notification in the browser. More information about getting Slack to
notify you can be found on this [Slack support
page](https://slack.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/201895138-Understanding-Slack-notifications),
including setting up email notification.

##More help
The [Slack support site](https://slack.zendesk.com/hc/en-us) has many
articles on using Slack. Or you can post a question to **#general**.
