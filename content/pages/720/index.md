Title: Course overview
Template: 720

This class is about prototyping physical artifacts that are connected
to the Internet: allowing things sensed about the physical world to be
acted on in the cloud, and to allow things happening on the Internet
to be reflected in the physical world. The focus of the class is on
learning by doing.

##Assignments and tasks

##Inspirations
This class has been heavily inspired, and in some cases modeled on, a
number of classes taught at other universities:

- [CMSC838f: Tangible Interactive
	Computing](http://cmsc838f-s15.wikispaces.com)
	taught by [Jon Froehlich](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~jonf/) at the University of Maryland.
- [CSCI7000: Physical
	Computing](https://trello.com/b/dserApBq/cu-physical-computing)
	taught by [Shaun Kane](http://shaunkane.info) at the University of
	Colorado Boulder.
- [CS294-84: Interactive Device
	Design](http://husk.eecs.berkeley.edu/courses/cs294-84-fall14/index.php/Main_Page)
	taught by [Bjoern Hartmann](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~bjoern/)
	at the University of California Berkeley.
- [INFO290-4: Tangible User
	Interfaces](http://courses.ischool.berkeley.edu/i290-4/f08/index.html)
	taught by [Kimiko Ryokai](http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~kimiko/) and others 
	at the University of California Berkeley.
- [CSCI6609: Ubiquitous
	Computing](https://web.cs.dal.ca/~reilly/CSCI6609/) taught by [Derek
	Reilly](https://web.cs.dal.ca/~reilly) at Dalhousie University.


##Resources
###Books
These are books that might be interesting for you to look at in
connection with this class. Some of them I'll use material from, but
I will provide you with anything I want you to read. I have copies of
all of these that you can look at or potentially borrow if I'm not in
need of it for class.

			Patterns to Make Sense of it All</a> by Adrian Mendoza<br>
			A book about designing for mobile devices. Goes into detail about
			iOS and Android and how to design good experiences for each.
			Includes details about mobile wireframing, patterns of use
			(launcher, tray, lists, rotations, service log-ins, camera,
			maps/location), prototyping, web vs apps, and metrics.

			Computing User Experience Design</a> by Mike Kuniavsky<br>
			This book goes into detail about designing user experiences for
			ubicomp devices. If we were going to have a textbook, this would
			be a good candidate. I'll use some of the material from this
			book in class. If you'd like to have a look at it, let me know.

			<a href='http://amzn.com/0321384016'>Everyware: The Dawning Age

			This is the other book I would have used as a textbook. It's
			pretty old at this point but is very thoughtful, illustrating
			how ubicomp is, in some ways, inevitable. It brings up a lot of
			ethical and societal concerns and implications.

			Like many books by Bruce Sterling, this one is a little bit in

			up a lot of thoughtful ideas around what it might mean for
			devices to be Internet-enabled.
