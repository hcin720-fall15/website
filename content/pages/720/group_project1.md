Title: Group Project 1
Template: 720

##Introduction
In the first three individual assignments, you learned how to get data
from the Internet and visualize it, how to interact with the online
world via hardware, and how to box it up and make it interesting. In
this first group assignment, you'll use all of these skills to develop
a synthesis of these topics: an ambient display.

##Goals
Your goal is to make an attractive ambient display that gives you
useful information about something relevant to your life. You should
work in a principled way, considering the previous work that
researchers in the area have done (see **Papers about ambient
displays** below as well as the class slides about metaphors; I'm
particularly partial to the *enchanted object* metaphor).

##Groups
This is a group project! You will work in groups of two, or, if you
have a really amazing idea and can convince me that it won't work
without more people, three. But I really want you to work in groups of
two.

##What to do
Here's what to do and how much of the total score for this assignment
each item will be worth:

- Build an attractive ambient display that visualizes a source of online
	information that is relevant to your life. **(50%)**
- There should be a clear mapping from the information to the
	visualization, such that you could explain the display to someone
	and they could understand it. **(10%)**
- The display should provide some way to catch the user's attention for
	notable events, preferably using the same visualization mechanism.
	**(5%)**
- You should be able to simulate a notable event for demonstration
	purposes. **(2%)**
- The display should be nice looking/sounding/feeling and not
	obviously technological in nature. Ideally the output will happen in
	a creative, non-obvious way. For example, if it's based on light,
	showing a graph with LEDs is obvious (see **Inspirations**
	below). **(13%)**
- Your documentation **(20%)** should include:
	- A description of the display, including pictures,
	- what choices you made for the information to display and the way
		you displayed it,
	- justification for your design based on previous research,
	- source code and 3D/2D model files.

###Tips
	
- You can put your display into another object if it makes sense. The
	[1979 Bang & Olufsen Raspberry Pi Internet
	Radio](http://www.instructables.com/id/1979-Bang-Olufsen-Raspberry-Pi-Internet-Radio/)
	Instructable project is a great example of this idea taken to an
	extreme.
- You can also use random objects for your display output. Be
	creative!

###Inspirations
Here are some examples of projects I found on
[Instructables](http://instructables.com), with some comments. Note
that most of them are *not* ambient displays, but contain parts that I
think would be suitable for an ambient display, or otherwise
illustrate something I think is cool.

- [Ambient temperature
	tapestry](http://www.instructables.com/id/ambient-temperature-tapestry/):
	This is a pretty good example of what I would like to see out of a class
	project. It's nice looking and it shows useful information. It doesn't
	connect to the net, and I would like it better with some less-obvious
	lights.
- [Mechanical music
	box](http://www.instructables.com/id/Build-a-Programmable-Mechanical-Music-Box/):
	It's not an ambient display but could be one. I particularly like
	the warm appearance and how it uses mechanical parts to make sound
	rather than a speaker.
- [Vibrating
	mirror](http://www.instructables.com/id/Vibrating-Pixels-Mechanical-Mirror/):
	This mirror has nine little circles that can vibrate independently,
	distorting the image. This very neatly falls into the *enchanted
	object* paradigm.
- [NeoWeather](http://www.instructables.com/id/NeoWeather-Ambient-Weather-Indicator/):
	This project uses a ring of RGB LEDs to indicate various things,
	including the weather or package delivery status. I like its
	ability, but it would lose points for this assignment because it's
	very technological-looking and the output is pretty obvious---just
	LED lights.	
- [Lego Mets home run
	indicator](http://www.instructables.com/id/Twitter-Activated-Home-Run-Indicator/):
	When the Mets have a home run announced on Twitter, the apple pops
	up! This is only semi-ambient, as it's really a binary display. I'd
	like to see a version that somehow includes a subtle indication of
	current score.
- [Twitter mood
	light](http://www.instructables.com/id/Twitter-Mood-Light-The-Worlds-Mood-in-a-Box/):
	Indicates the current overall mood of Twitter via light. I'd like it
	even better if the display was less LED-ish looking.
- [Tweiger counter](http://www.instructables.com/id/the-tweiger-counter/):
	A "Twitter Geiger counter" which searches Twitter for particular
	words and makes a clicking sound, so you have an idea of the
	"density" of tweets on a particular subject. It also has a meter.
	This project would get an A.

	changing values.

	houses, three contain colourful birds which react to Twitter triggers,
	the fourth is a simple clock. A new follower, a retweet or an @message
	will trigger one of the birds to pop out of its house, each with a
	different movement. Optional birdsong can accompany each action, the
	volume controlled with a small dial."
