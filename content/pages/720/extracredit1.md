Title: Extra Credit 1
Template: 720

For one point of extra credit on your final grade, do these
intermediate steps to get familiar with the laser cutter. Use
cardboard for all of these steps.

1. Cut out a simple shape such as a circle or square. Experiment with
	 the power settings until you get a good feeling for what works.
	 Note the settings.
2. Cut out another shape with a raster added. Experiment with the
	 power settings until you get a good feeling for what works.
	 Note the settings.
3. Cut something cool (see example below). If you're not sure what
	 qualifies as "cool," ask. It should be of your own design.
4. Cut something 3D (e.g. with [123D
	 Make](http://www.123dapp.com/make) or
	 [BoxMaker](http://boxmaker.connectionlab.org/)). It should be of
	 your own design.

Example of something cool:

##Deliverables
Bring the things you laser cut to class. If you're worried about
whether what you made in step 3 is cool, ask in advance!
